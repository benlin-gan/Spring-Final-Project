You can make whatever you wish, but it must have a GUI (graphical user interface). 

Like the fall final project, the difficulty will determine the maximum grade (90%, 95%, or 100%), but the project will need to work and have code that follows our class practices to earn that maximum.

When you have submitted the project here, you MUST also submit a zip file of the project on Canvas and take my end of the year survey if you want me to be able to grade it.

Soon I will ask you what your project will be and tell you what I think the difficulty will be. I reserve the right to increase the difficulty rating based on the work you do, but I will not decrease it.

The projects are due the morning of senior finals and you will demo them on that day.
